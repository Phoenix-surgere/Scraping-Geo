# Problem Statement
Store information about auctions of plots that are being posted on [this](https://minagric.gr/dimoprasies-gr/perif-en-ebrou-dimoprasies) website.
The website has a table, where each of its rows corresponds to an auction. The table has two columns, which store the auctions’ webpages and posting dates, respectively. The table is chronologically ordered, so recent auctions are shown first.
All auctions’ webpages have the same [structure](https://minagric.gr/dimoprasies-gr/perif-en-ebrou-dimoprasies/17249-dhmoprasia-evros375020-181124), that is, the information for each auction is stored in a table in their middle part. All tables have one row, three columns, and a legend. The columns store information about the auctions’ official declarations as URLs that redirect to the documents, the regarding plots’ area, and the intended use of each plot, respectively.  Lastly, the legends store information about the time the auctions are being conducted.
The required information about each auction is:
1.	the official declaration,
2.	the posting date, and
3.	the conduction date.
## Notes
For some of the auctions, the official declaration is split up into two documents, where the second contains geographical information about the auctioned plots, such as their coordinates. If that’s the case, the second document can be accessed via a URL that is stored in the second column of the table in each auction’s webpage.
